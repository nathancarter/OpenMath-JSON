\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:concl}

We have proposed a new OpenMath JSON encoding that facilitates the content-oriented
communication of mathematical objects and formulae in the web applications and web
services arena. Our encoding combines the advantages of existing approaches, alleviates
their problems, and enables validation via a JSON schema we provide. To support
development with the new encoding, we supply a JSON validation service and a JSON/XML
encoding translation service.

In the future we hope that the OpenMath Society will canonicalize a JSON encoding for
OpenMath using our proposal as a basis.
