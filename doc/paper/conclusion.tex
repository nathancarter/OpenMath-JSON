\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:concl}

In this paper we have established that an OpenMath JSON encoding enables using OpenMath in many programming languages. 
The existing approaches for such an encoding did not make use of many of the native JSON features, hence we have developed our own encoding. 
This encoding is both easily translatable to and from the JSON encoding and makes use of native JSON features.
