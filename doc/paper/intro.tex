\section{Introduction}

OpenMath~\cite {BusCapCar:oms04} is a semantic representation format of mathematical objects and formulae. 
In a nutshell, OpenMath standardizes six basic object types (symbols, variables, numbers, strings, and foreign objects), three ways of building complex objects: (function) application, binding, and management facilities like structure sharing and error reporting. 
The OpenMath object model underlies Content MathML~\cite{CarlisleEd:MathML3:on}, making it well-integrated with MathML presentation. 

There are several encodings of OpenMath Objects, most notably the XML and Binary encodings. 
In this paper we propose another one based on JSON, a lightweight data-interchange format that used heavily in the Web Applications area.

JSON~\cite{JSON:web}, short for \textbf{J}ava\textbf{S}cript \textbf{O}bject \textbf{N}otation, is a lightweight data-interchange format.
While being a subset of JavaScript, it is defined independently. 
JSON can represent both primitive types and composite types.

Primitive JSON data types are strings (e.g. \lstinline{"Hello world"}), Numbers (e.g. \lstinline{42} or \lstinline{3.14159265}), Booleans (\lstinline{true} and \lstinline{false}) and \lstinline{null}. 
Composite JSON types are either (non-homogeneous) arrays (e.g. \lstinline{[1, "two", false]}) or key-value pairs called objects (e.g. \lstinline|{"foo": "bar", "answer": 42}|).

Constructs corresponding to JSON objects are found in most programming languages. 
Furthermore, the syntax is very simple; hence many languages have built-in facilities for translating their existing data structures to and from JSON. 
The use for an OpenMath JSON encoding is clear: It would enable easy use of OpenMath across many languages.

In the next Section we survey two existing OpenMath JSON encodings. 
Section~\ref{sec:encoding} proposes a new encoding that combines the advantages and alleviates their disadvantages. 
We give a thorough specification of the encoding, present a JSON schema implemented in TypeScript, and provide a web service that validates JSON-encoded OpenMath and transforms OpenMath objects between XML and JSON encodings. 
Section~\ref{sec:concl} concludes the paper.
